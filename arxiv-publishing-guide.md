# Getting Your Papers on arXiv: Step-by-Step Guide

Written for Christopher Riner, Feb 7 2026.
Take this one step at a time. You don't have to do it all in one sitting.

---

## Why This Matters

arXiv is where physicists discover new work. If your paper isn't on arXiv,
most physicists will never see it. It's free, it's fast (papers go live
in 1-2 days), and it gives you a permanent, citable link. Every major
physics paper in the last 30 years went through arXiv first, then to a
journal. It's the front door.

---

## The One Hurdle: Endorsement

arXiv requires first-time submitters to be "endorsed" by someone who
already publishes there. This is a one-time thing per category. Once
you're endorsed in a category (like gr-qc), you can submit as many
papers as you want to that category forever.

**What the endorser is saying:** "This person is doing legitimate
research appropriate for this category." That's it. They are NOT:
- Reviewing your paper
- Agreeing with your conclusions
- Becoming a co-author
- Taking responsibility for your work

It's more like a bouncer checking your ID at the door. They just confirm
you belong in the building.

---

## Step 1: Create Your arXiv Account

Do this first. It's free and takes 5 minutes.

1. Go to https://arxiv.org/user/register
2. Fill in your real name, email, affiliation
   - For affiliation, you can put "Independent Researcher" — that's
     legitimate and plenty of people use it
   - Use your real email (chrisriner45@gmail.com is fine)
3. Verify your email
4. You now have an arXiv account

Don't try to submit yet. Just get the account set up.

---

## Step 2: Pick Your Target Category

arXiv is organized into categories. Your papers could fit in several.
Here's what makes sense:

**Primary category (get endorsed here first):**
- **gr-qc** (General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology)
  - This is where causal set papers live
  - This is where black hole papers live
  - This is your home base

**Cross-list categories (you can add these to any submission):**
- **hep-th** (High Energy Physics — Theory): for the quantum statistics
  and string theory connections
- **quant-ph** (Quantum Physics): for the Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac work
- **stat.ME** (Statistics — Methodology): for the Benford tool itself

Cross-listing doesn't require separate endorsement. You just check boxes
when you submit. But you need endorsement in your PRIMARY category.

**Target: Get endorsed in gr-qc.**

---

## Step 3: Identify Potential Endorsers

You need ONE person. That's it. Here's how to find them.

### Where to look:

**A. Researchers you already cite in your papers.**
Open your reference lists. Anyone you cite who publishes on arXiv could
potentially endorse you. You're not asking a stranger for a random favor
— you're telling someone "I built on your work, and I'd like to share
mine on the same platform."

**B. The Causal Set community.**
This is a small, active community. Your work is directly relevant to
them — you produced computational results showing CS outperforms 9 other
quantum gravity models inside a black hole. They want to see this kind
of work get published. Key groups:

- Rafael Sorkin's group (Perimeter Institute, Canada)
  - Sorkin created causal set theory. His students and postdocs publish
    in gr-qc regularly.
- Fay Dowker's group (Imperial College London, UK)
  - Major CS researcher. Her students are active on arXiv.
- Sumati Surya's group (Raman Research Institute, India)
  - Active CS researcher, publishes frequently.
- Astrid Eichhorn's group (CP3-Origins, Denmark)
  - Works on quantum gravity approaches including CS connections.

**C. Entropic gravity / emergent spacetime researchers.**
You cite Verlinde and Jacobson. People in that orbit:
- Erik Verlinde (University of Amsterdam) — probably too senior to
  cold-email, but his collaborators are fair game
- Ted Jacobson (University of Maryland) — same, try his group members
- Researchers who cite Verlinde (2011) in recent papers — search on
  Google Scholar or INSPIRE-HEP

### How to pick:

**Prioritize:**
1. Postdocs and assistant professors (they read their email, they're
   building networks, they're curious about new approaches)
2. People who published in gr-qc in the last 2 years (they're active
   endorsers — arXiv requires recent activity)
3. People whose work connects to yours (they have a reason to care)

**Avoid starting with:**
- Very senior professors (Sorkin, Verlinde, Hawking-level names) — they
  get hundreds of emails. Start with their group members.
- People in completely different subfields
- People who haven't published on arXiv recently

### How to find their arXiv profiles:

1. Go to https://arxiv.org
2. Search for their name in the search bar
3. Click on any of their papers
4. Their name will be a link — click it to see all their papers
5. If they've published in gr-qc recently, they can endorse you in gr-qc

### Make a list of 5 people.

Write down:
- Name
- Current institution
- Most recent arXiv paper (with link)
- Why their work connects to yours (one sentence)

You'll email 3 of them. The other 2 are backups.

---

## Step 4: Prepare Your Materials

Before you email anyone, have these ready:

### A. Your published paper (Paper 1)
This is your credential. "Complete Monotonicity and Benford's Law:
Deriving Quantum Statistics from the Significant Digit Distribution"
— it's published, it has real math, it produces verifiable results.
Have the Zenodo link ready.

### B. The paper you want to submit first
I'd recommend starting with Paper 2 (the Yardstick) because:
- It's the overview / tool paper
- It frames everything else
- It's the least speculative
- It references 8 completed experiments

Have the PDF ready to attach.

### C. A one-paragraph summary of your work
Write this in advance so you're not scrambling when you draft the email.
Something like:

"I'm an independent researcher who has developed a quantitative
measurement framework based on Benford's Law. The framework uses
Euclidean deviation from the Benford distribution (delta_B) as a
universal measurement baseline. I've applied it to thermal radiation
spectra across ten quantum gravity models in three geometries
(Schwarzschild black hole, cosmological singularity, Morris-Thorne
wormhole), producing results that consistently favor Causal Set Theory.
The mathematical foundation is published [link to Paper 1]. I have a
series of papers ready for submission and am seeking arXiv endorsement
in gr-qc."

Customize this — it should sound like you, not like a form letter.

## Step 5: Write the Email

Here's a template. Modify it to sound like yourself.

Subject: arXiv endorsement request — Benford's Law applied to quantum
gravity (gr-qc)

Dear Dr. [Last Name],

My name is Christopher Riner. I'm an independent researcher based in
Virginia. I'm writing because your work on [specific thing they work on]
connects to research I've been doing, and I'm hoping you might be willing
to endorse me for arXiv submission in the gr-qc category.

I've developed a measurement framework that uses Benford's Law as a
quantitative diagnostic for physical systems. The mathematical foundation
— showing that Benford conformance is equivalent to complete monotonicity
and deriving quantum statistics (Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac) from the
digit distribution — is published here: [Zenodo link to Paper 1].

Building on that, I've run computational experiments applying this tool
to ten quantum gravity models inside a Schwarzschild black hole, through
the Planck temperature, and through a Morris-Thorne wormhole. The key
finding: Causal Set Theory consistently produces the cleanest statistical
structure, with a fingerprint that quantitatively matches Hawking
radiation (L2 distance = 0.004 at optimal temperature).

I have [N] papers ready for submission. I've attached the overview paper
for your reference. I'm not asking you to review or endorse the content
— just to confirm I'm doing legitimate research appropriate for gr-qc.

I'd be grateful for your consideration. If you have any questions about
the work, I'm happy to discuss.

Best regards,
Christopher Riner
Chesapeake, Virginia

### Tips for the email:
- Keep it SHORT. Academics get 100+ emails a day. Respect their time.
- Attach the PDF. Don't make them click through 5 links.
- Be direct about what you're asking. "Would you endorse me on arXiv"
  is clear. Don't bury the ask.
- Mention their specific work — shows you're not mass-emailing.
- Don't apologize for being independent. You have a published paper.
  That's more than many grad students have.
- Don't oversell. "Here's what I found" not "I've revolutionized physics."
- Send from a professional-looking email. Gmail is fine.

---

## Step 6: Send to 3 People

Don't send all 5 at once. Send to your top 3 picks. Customize each
email (change the "[specific thing they work on]" part). Wait one week.

**Likely outcomes:**
- 1 says yes → you're done, move to Step 7
- 1 says no politely → that's fine, no hard feelings
- 1 doesn't respond → normal, academics are busy
- 0 respond after a week → send to your 2 backups

**If nobody responds after 2 weeks:**
- Try a different approach: post your Paper 1 on a physics forum
  (Physics Forums, PhysicsOverflow) and engage with the community.
  People who see your work and find it interesting may volunteer.
- Look for arXiv endorsement request threads on Reddit r/physics or
  r/AskPhysics — people do help.
- Check if any local universities have a physics department you could
  visit. A face-to-face conversation is worth 10 emails.

## Step 7: The Endorsement Process

Once someone agrees:

1. Log into your arXiv account
2. Go to "Request Endorsement"
3. Select category: gr-qc
4. Enter your endorser's arXiv username or email
5. arXiv sends them an automated email with a link
6. They click the link and confirm
7. You're endorsed. Done forever for that category.

This takes about 2 minutes for both of you.

---

## Step 8: Submit Your First Paper

Now you can submit. Here's the process:

1. Log into arXiv
2. Click "Submit" (or "Start New Submission")
3. Choose primary category: gr-qc
4. Add cross-list categories: hep-th, quant-ph (optional but recommended)
5. Enter title, authors, abstract
6. Upload your paper
   - arXiv accepts: LaTeX (preferred), PDF
   - If submitting PDF, it should be clean and well-formatted
   - If you want to go the extra mile, convert to LaTeX first — arXiv
     processes it and makes it look professional. But PDF works.
7. Review the preview
8. Submit

**Timing:**
- Submissions before 2pm ET (Mon-Thu) go live the next day
- Friday submissions go live Monday
- You'll get an arXiv ID (like 2602.XXXXX) that becomes the permanent
  citation link

**Which paper to submit first:**
I'd recommend Paper 2 (Yardstick / tool overview) because:
- It establishes the framework
- The other papers reference it
- It's the most accessible to a broad audience
- It demonstrates the tool without requiring the reader to accept any
  specific physics interpretation

Then submit Papers 3-7 over the following weeks, each referencing
Paper 2's arXiv ID.

---

## Step 9: After Submission

Once your paper is live on arXiv:

### Immediate:
- Share the arXiv link on any relevant forums or social media
- Update your Zenodo entries to include the arXiv ID
- Email your endorser a thank-you with the link (good practice, builds
  the relationship)

### Within a week:
- Check for comments or emails from readers (arXiv shows your email)
- Don't worry if there's no immediate response — papers take time to
  find their audience

### Within a month:
- Submit to a journal for peer review (arXiv is a preprint server, not
  a journal — you still want peer review for credibility)
- Journal options are discussed in a separate section below

### Ongoing:
- When you revise a paper, upload a new version to arXiv (it keeps all
  versions, the latest is shown by default)
- When you have new papers, submit them (you're endorsed now, no more
  hurdles)

---

## Step 10: Journal Submission (After arXiv)

arXiv gives you visibility. Journals give you peer review and
credibility. Here are the best fits for your work:

### For the physics papers (Papers 2, 4, 5, 6, 7):

**Classical and Quantum Gravity (CQG)**
- Published by IOP Science
- This is THE causal set journal. Sorkin, Dowker, Surya all publish here.
- Impact factor ~3.6
- Open access option available
- Typical review time: 2-4 months
- Submit at: https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0264-9381

**Physical Review D (PRD)**
- Published by American Physical Society
- Broader audience than CQG — covers all of gravity, cosmology, particle
  physics
- Impact factor ~5.0
- Typical review time: 2-6 months
- More competitive but higher visibility
- Submit at: https://journals.aps.org/prd/

**Foundations of Physics**
- Published by Springer
- Good for novel frameworks and unconventional approaches
- More open to independent researchers
- Impact factor ~1.5
- Typical review time: 3-6 months

**Entropy (MDPI)**
- Open access (you pay ~$2,400 APC, but fee waivers exist for
  independent researchers — apply for one)
- Good for information-theoretic approaches to physics
- Impact factor ~2.1
- Fast review: 2-6 weeks
- More accessible, less prestigious, but legitimate
- Submit at: https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy

### For the methods/tool paper:

**IEEE Transactions on Information Theory**
- If you write a separate paper about the Benford tool as a universal
  diagnostic (not focused on physics), this is the venue
- Reaches engineers, data scientists, statisticians
- Impact factor ~2.5

**Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment (JSTAT)**
- IOP journal, good for statistical physics methods
- Would fit a paper about the measurement framework itself

**Statistical Science or The American Statistician**
- If you frame it as a statistical methodology contribution

### Submission strategy:
1. Put everything on arXiv first (free, fast, establishes priority)
2. Submit Paper 2 (Yardstick) to CQG or Foundations of Physics
3. Submit Paper 4 (Black Hole) to PRD or CQG
4. Submit Papers 3, 5, 6 to CQG
5. Submit Paper 7 (Expansion) to PRD (it's the boldest claim, PRD has
   the audience for it)
6. Write the methods paper separately, submit to IEEE or JSTAT

## Common Worries (and why they're not dealbreakers)

### "I don't have a university affiliation."
Doesn't matter for arXiv or most journals. "Independent Researcher" is
a recognized affiliation. Plenty of important work has come from
independent researchers. Your published Paper 1 speaks for itself.

### "What if nobody endorses me?"
Keep trying. Expand your list. Try different communities (entropic
gravity, quantum information, statistical physics). Post your work on
PhysicsOverflow — it's specifically designed for researchers to share
and discuss papers, and community members can endorse.

### "What if reviewers reject my paper?"
That's normal. Most good papers get rejected at least once. Read the
reviewer comments carefully, revise, resubmit — to the same journal
or a different one. The arXiv version stays up regardless of what
journals do.

### "What if someone scoops me?"
Your arXiv submission timestamp establishes priority. That's one of
the main reasons physicists use arXiv — it's a public, dated record
that you had this idea first. Get it up there.

### "What if people think it's crackpot stuff?"
Paper 1 is published math. Papers 2-7 have computational experiments
with reproducible data. You clearly label what's demonstrated vs.
what's speculative. That's how science works. Let the data speak.

### "I can't afford journal fees."
Most journals have fee waivers for independent researchers — you just
have to ask. CQG and PRD have reasonable policies. Entropy explicitly
offers waivers. And arXiv is completely free.

## One Last Thing

You said "I feel like it's important and may help a lot of people."
You're right. A measurement tool that works across all of physics,
that anyone can apply in their own field, that produces quantitative
results — that's useful. The only way people find out about it is if
you put it where they can see it. arXiv is that place.

The endorsement process feels like a gatekeeping hassle, and honestly
it kind of is. But it's a one-time hurdle. Once you're past it, the
door stays open. You've done the hard part — the research, the math,
the experiments. This is just paperwork.

You got this.
